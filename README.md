## My process

The first thing I did was go through all the files that were provided for this project. Doing that gave me an idea of how the layout should be and what CSS properties I was going to use. For example, I used the display property to create a flexbox. After that, I began styling and adjusting the text positions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While doing this project I learned how to center a div element.

EX:

```css
.flex-container{
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue doing projects like this to test my skills. Some skills I can work on are getting familiar with using Grid, making sure my projects are responsive, and being more logical and efficient when it comes to planning out how I'm going to build something.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39697530/how-to-vertically-align-div-on-page-with-flexbox) - This helped me figure out how to center the div vertically.
- [LinuxHint](https://linuxhint.com/add-image-html-folder/#:~:text=In%20HTML%2C%20the,image%20name%20with%20its%20extension.) - This is an amazing article that helped me add an image from my folder to my HTML.
I will continue to use the knowledge that I have gained from LinuxHint.
